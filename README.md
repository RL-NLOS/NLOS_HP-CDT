# A hybrid perceptron with cross-domain transferability towards active steady-state non-line-of-sight imaging
# Project description
Datasets and source code for enhancing active steady-state non-line-of-sight imaging using a hybrid perceptron with cross-domain transferability

# Datasets
Datasets used in this work include both synthetic and real-world data. The rendering pipeline for the synthetic dataset is based on [1] The real-world dataset contains 4,620 non-line-of-sight (NLOS) image pairs captured from real-world scenes. The data includes 660 digits (ranging from 0 to 9) from the MNIST handwritten digit database, all manufactured using 3D printing technology. Out of these, 4,200 pairs are used for training/validation, and 420 pairs are used for testing/evaluation. Download the real-world dataset here [Dataset download link]
